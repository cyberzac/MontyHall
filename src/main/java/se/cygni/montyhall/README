A simulation of the Monty Hall problem, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.
This implementation uses a fluent interface and a domain model.

Problem description:
Assume that you are attending a TV show where you can win money by picking the right box.
The game show host shows you three boxes explaining that the money is in one of the boxes.
He asks you to pick one of them. After you have picked box number one he opens box number three knowing that the money is not in this box.
Now he turns to you and asks, do you want to change your mind, picking box number two instead of box number on?


Your task:
Write a small program in Java randomly simulating this event over and over again in the quest of answering following question.
Do I stand a better chance to win if I change my mind?
Depend only on the JDK.
